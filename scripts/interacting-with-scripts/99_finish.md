Well done! You've learned how to write DAML scripts and initialized your own social network. You
started the DAML REPL and used the scripting language against a real ledger interactively. That's a
powerful skill to have!

If you want to learn more on advanced DAML script topics, have a look at the
[documentation](https://docs.daml.com/daml-script/index.html). For example, DAML script can be run
in a distributed setup, where you can submit commands to different participant hosts. It can also
run directly against the HTTP JSON API.

As always, if you have any questions or problems, connect with the DAML Community on the [DAML
forum](https://discuss.daml.com).
