In this tutorial you learned how to extend the data model of a DAML ledger buy uploading a new
package. You now understand

1. DAML packages and how you can include them as a dependency
1. DAML package ID's and how they change if your DAML code changes **or** if one of its dependencies
   changes.

In the second article on upgrading DAML ledgers, you will learn how to upgrade DAML code that is
already running on a ledger, and how to migrate the existing contracts over to your new schema.

As always, if you have any questions or problems, connect with the DAML Community on the [DAML
forum](https://discuss.daml.com).
