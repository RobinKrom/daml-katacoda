This tutorial shows you how you can upgrade and extend an existing
DAML application that already has live data on the ledger.

We tackle the problem in three steps:

1. Implement the DAML models for our old application, the new version
   of our application and the ugrade models to move from the old to
   the new.
1. Structure these models into packages and deploy them to the ledger.
1. Automate the upgrade flow using DAML Script and DAML Triggers.

Letâ€™s get started!
