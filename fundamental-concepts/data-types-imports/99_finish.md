In this scenario you learned how to model data with DAML. You now know 

  - how to write your own data types
  - structure your code into modules and import them
  - how to import the standard library 

In the next Katacoda of the [fundamental concepts](https://daml.com/learn/fundamental-concepts)
course you will take a tour of [DAML's standard library](https://daml.com/learn/fundamental-concepts/stdlib-tour), where you'll see common container types like
lists, maps, sets and optional data.

Come and connect with the DAML Community on the [DAML forum](https://discuss.daml.com) and share
your insights, questions and suggestions!
