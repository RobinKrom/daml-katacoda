Weâ€™ll start by getting the app up and running, and then explain the different components which we will later extend.

First off, open a terminal and instantiate the template project. You can click on the below snippets to run them in the terminal.

```
daml new create-daml-app create-daml-app
```{{execute T1}}

This creates a new folder with contents from our template. Change to the new folder:

```
cd create-daml-app
```{{execute T1}}

Any commands starting with daml are using the [DAML Assistant](https://docs.daml.com/tools/assistant.html), a command line tool in the DAML SDK for building and running DAML apps.

Note: If you want to see the code within the `create-daml-app` project click on the IDE tab. You don't need to wait for it to fully load before continuing.
